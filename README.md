# Machine Failure Prediction using ML ALgorithm

# Problem Sataement : 
Build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of machine failure based on the provided features such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. The model should be able to classify instances into two categories: normal operation (no failure) and impending failure.

# Objective :
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast machine failures based on various operational parameters collected during the manufacturing process.

# Dataset:
The dataset contains information on different machines, including product ID, machine type, air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, tool wear, and various indicators related to machine health. The dataset includes instances where machines have experienced failure (labeled as "Machine failure" in the dataset).

# Key Challenges:

* The dataset may be imbalanced, with a relatively small number of instances representing machine failures. Addressing class imbalance is crucial for model training and evaluation.
* Identifying the most informative features and understanding their impact on predicting machine failure.
* Developing a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data to ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
